  title: "About the Course"
  first_paragraph: "<p>One of the biggest changes happening today, is the shift toward online education.</p> 

<p>Today, there is a growing number of individual “teacher entrepreneurs” organizing what they know on any topic you can imagine into making thousands or in some case over a hundred thousand dollars in income every month.</p>

<p>The benefits of teaching an online course are remarkable. Unlike any other form, structuring what you know in a course allows you to create a connection with your audience, whether that’s to build your own following or to promote your company.</p>

<p>How did this come to be? In recent years, all the parts you need to produce courses – the best practices, technology and open distribution channels – have all become available for anyone to use.</p>

<p><strong><span class='underline'>Million Dollar Instructor</span></strong> is the comprehensive set of video lessons that will take you behind the scenes and teach you everything you need to create and launch an online course – from the best in the industry.</p>

<p>Throughout, you’ll be led by John Nichols and Eliot Arntz, Founders of the independent course studio Bitfountain.io. They’ll take you from their beginning to their incredible success – since April this year, John and Eliot have produced courses which have generated over $1M in revenue:</p>

  second_paragraph: "<p>You might have a variety of goals before coming into this course – whether that’s creating a short course to promote your company or grow your thought leadership while making income on the side, or whether its to learn the best practices to becoming a “teacher entrepreneur.” </p>

<p>This course will take from scratch all the way to finishing and selling your course, namely these two parts:</p>

<strong><p>Part 1: Develop your course</strong><br/>

How you should pick your topic and test market demand for it. You’ll learn how to evaluate the success of your topic before investing time and energy much into producing the content. </p>

<p>You’ll also learn how to develop amazing content, without the need for expensive tools and software. You’ll also get the specific research and scripting skills that will save you significant time while you’re creating content. </p>

<strong><p>Part 2: Market your course</strong><br/>

Here, we’ll bring in folks we’ve gotten to know along our journey such as Conrad and Ankur who will take you into topics such as pricing your course, structuring a successful pre-launch and ultimately getting your course successfully out of the gates. </p>

<p>This section will include details on when you should start promoting (hint: NOW) and include the landing pages and copy from email campaigns you can use to build excitement before your course is ready. </p>

<p>From there, we’ll show you how to promote your course including the complete list of strategies and tactics the best are using such as Business Development, Reddit, eBooks, KickStarter, Business Development, Email and more than 10 others. </p>

<p>Afterwards, we’ll go into what happens post-purchase, including keeping students really happy, creating a pipeline of future digital products and setting yourself up to make these campaigns create engaged fans. </p>

<p>On top of this detailed content, this course will also include over 6 hours of interviews from 10 of the most successful teacher entrepreneurs including Nathan Berry who sold more than $500,000 in educational products and Mark Lassoff who leverages the Amazon and Safari bookstores to make sales and drive traffic to his courses.</p>
