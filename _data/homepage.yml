  qa:
    - question: "What plan do you recommend?"
      answer: "We recommend you start with the Free plan and try the service before deciding to upgrade to any of the more powerful plans."
    - question: "Does Fedora charge a setup fee?"
      answer: "There are absolutely no set up fees of any kind - you can launch your school entirely for free."
    - question: "Who pays for hosting and video bandwidth?"
      answer: "All content hosting (including video) is completely included in the Fedora monthly and transaction fees. And yes, there is no limit to your bandwidth usage."
    - question: "Am I allowed to offer free courses with Fedora?"
      answer: "Absolutely - you can offer free courses and there are no transaction fees with free courses at all. If you don't make money, we don't make money."
    - question: "How do transaction fees work?"
      answer: "Every time a user purchases anything on your school, we collect the Transaction Fee according to your plan - the greater your monthly plan, the lower your transaction fee. You'll never have to pay more than the sale price of the course though - so if you are on the Free plan and sell a course for a $1, we'll only take $1 and not $1.10."
