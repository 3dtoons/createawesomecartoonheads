In recent years, all the parts you need to produce courses – the best practices, technology and open distribution channels – have all become available for anyone to use.</p><p><strong><span class='underline'>Million Dollar Instructor</span></strong> is the comprehensive set of video lessons that will take you behind the scenes and teach you everything you need to create and launch an online course – from the best in the industry.</p><p>Throughout, you’ll be led by John Nichols and Eliot Arntz, Founders of the independent course studio Bitfountain.io. They’ll take you from their beginning to their incredible success – since April this year, John and Eliot have produced courses which have generated over $1M in revenue:</p>"
